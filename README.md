## Project Charter
### Vision
Help college students in shortlisting universities with their profiles by giving them a fair idea of their chances of being admitted to graduate schools
### Mission
Create an interative web application to predict chances of graduate admission given a user's input of parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The underlying model will be a regression model based on the graduate admission dataset. This application will assist college students in deciding their chance of admission to graduate schools.
