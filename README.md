## Project Charter
### Vision
Help college students in shortlisting universities with their profiles by giving them a fair idea of their chances of being admitted to graduate schools
### Mission
Create an interative web application to predict chances of graduate admission given a user's input of parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The underlying model will be a regression model based on the graduate admission dataset. This application will assist college students in deciding their chance of admission to graduate schools. 
### Success Criteria
- The sucess of the regression model will be based on achieving a RMSE below 0.1 and an R-Squared above 0.75 on the test dataset. 
- The sucess of the application will be measured by the number of visits to app in an interval time (especially application seasons) and the number of new user engagements throughout the time.
