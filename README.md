## Project Charter
### Vision
Help 
Help college students in shortlisting universities with their profiles by giving them a fair idea of their chances of being admitted to graduate schools
### Mission
Create an interative web application to predict chances of graduate admission given a user's input of parameters which are considered important during the application for Masters Programs. The underlying model will be a regression model based on the graduate admission dataset. This application will assist college students in deciding their chance of admission to graduate schools. 
### Success Criteria
- The sucess of the regression model will be based on achieving a RMSE below 0.1 and an R-Squared above 0.75 on the test dataset. 
- The sucess of the application from the business persective will be measured by the number of visits to app in an interval time (especially during application seasons) and the number of new user engagements throughout the time.

### Initiatives


Wine lovers always hope to spend their money on wines they will actually enjoy. However, without actually tasting the wine, it is often challenging for people to predict wine quality ahead of time. Even though a few famous wine critics do provide ratings on wine, those scores are still based on their subjective experience.

The aim of this project is to investigate how the taste of wines are related to their measurable physiochemical properties (e.g. pH, volatile acidity, residual sugar, sulfur dioxide, etc.). Through various machine learning methods, the project will help to identify the most physiochemical properties that make a wine taste good as well as allow users to predict the quality of wines based on their physiochemical properties. In this way, users will be able to assess wine quality from a more objective perspective and make better buying decisions.

The final web app would allow user to input values of the most important physiochemical properties of wine (either white or red) and return the predicted wine quality.
