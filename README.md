## Project Charter
### Vision
Help people gain a fair idea of the cost of their treatments billed by insurance companies. Help insurance companies determined the appropriate premium they should collect to make profits. 
### Mission
Create an interative web application to predict health care costs given a user's input of factors that may influence the charge of a specific patient. The underlying model will be a regression model based on the Medical Cost Personal Dataset with 1338 observations from Kaggle. This application will assist insurance company in deciding the premiums they should collect
### Success Criteria
- The sucess of the regression model will be based on achieving a RMSE below 0.1 and an R-Squared above 0.75 on the test dataset. 
- The sucess of the application from the business persective will be measured by the number of visits to app in an interval time (especially during application seasons) and the number of new user engagements throughout the time.

### Initiatives


Wine lovers always hope to spend their money on wines they will actually enjoy. However, without actually tasting the wine, it is often challenging for people to predict wine quality ahead of time. Even though a few famous wine critics do provide ratings on wine, those scores are still based on their subjective experience.

The aim of this project is to investigate how the taste of wines are related to their measurable physiochemical properties (e.g. pH, volatile acidity, residual sugar, sulfur dioxide, etc.). Through various machine learning methods, the project will help to identify the most physiochemical properties that make a wine taste good as well as allow users to predict the quality of wines based on their physiochemical properties. In this way, users will be able to assess wine quality from a more objective perspective and make better buying decisions.

The final web app would allow user to input values of the most important physiochemical properties of wine (either white or red) and return the predicted wine quality.
